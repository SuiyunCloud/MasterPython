# What

The Prototype Pattern is used to create new objects by cloning an original object,
and then modifying the clone.

# How
Easy to relize that.

## Classic Abatract Factory
```python
def make_object(Class, *args, **kwargs):
return Class(*args, **kwargs)
point1 =Point(1, 2)
point2 =eval("{}({}, {})".format("Point", 2, 4)) # Risky
point3 =getattr(sys.modules[__name__], "Point")(3, 6)
point4 =globals()["Point"](4, 8)
point5 =make_object(Point, 5, 10)
point6 =copy.deepcopy(point5)
point6.x= 6
point6.y= 12
point7 =point1.__class__(7, 14) # Could have used any of point1 to point6
```
