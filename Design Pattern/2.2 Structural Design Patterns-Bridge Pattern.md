# Usage
The Bridge Pattern is used in situations where we want to separate an abstrac-
tion (e.g., an interface or an algorithm) from how it is implemented.


# Way to realize

To create two independent class hierarchies: the “abstract” one defining 
the operations (e.g., the interface and high-level algorithms) and the concrete one
providing the implementations that the abstract operations will ultimately call.
