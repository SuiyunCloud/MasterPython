# Usage
The Flyweight Pattern(享元模式) is designed for handling large numbers of relatively
small objects, where many of the small objects are duplicates of each other. The
pattern is implemented by representing each unique object only once, and by
sharing this unique instance wherever it is needed.

Python takes a naturally flyweight approach because of its use of object
references.
