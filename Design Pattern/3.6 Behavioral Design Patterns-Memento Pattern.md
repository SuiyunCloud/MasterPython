# Usage
saving and restoring an object’s state without violating encapsulation

Python can pickle None , bool s, bytearray s,
bytes , complex es, float s, int s, and str s, as well as dict s, list s, and tuple s that con-
tain only pickleable objects (including collections), top-level functions, top-level
classes, and instances of custom top-level classes whose __dict__ is pickleable;
that is, objects of most custom classes. It is also possible to achieve the same
effect using the json module, although this only supports Python’s basic types along with dictionaries and lists.
